Yak Shave: [Create Giter8 template](#giter8-template)


Yak Shaves
==========

## Giter8 Template

This is really the start of the idea for extending Advent Of Code with yak shaving.
I learned about AOC (Advent Of Code), wanted to do Day 1 right away, and found myself mucking about with a Giter8 template before I wrote my first line of code.
So, it only seemed appropriate.
My first yak shave was creating a [Giter8 template](https://github.com/valencik/scala-starter.g8) to create this repo.
